    <h2>About WARZONE</h2>
    <p>Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale game developed and published by Activision. It is a part of the larger Call of Duty franchise. In Warzone, players are dropped onto a map with up to 150 players, and the goal is to be the last person or team standing. The game combines elements of traditional first-person shooter gameplay with the battle royale genre.</p>
    <p>Warzone features a large, open-world map called Verdansk (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021). Players can explore the map, collect weapons, armor, and equipment, and engage in intense firefights with other players. The game also introduces a unique feature called the "Gulag," where eliminated players get a chance to fight their way back into the match.</p>
    <p>The game offers various modes, including solo, duo, and team-based playlists, allowing players to choose their preferred playstyle. It also features cross-platform play, enabling players from different platforms (such as PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) to play together.</p>

The game features a round-based system, and teams switch sides after each round.</p>
    <p>Valorant emphasizes teamwork, communication, and strategy. Each agent has a set of unique abilities that can be used strategically to gain an advantage over the opposing team. The game also features a wide array of weapons, including rifles, pistols, and sniper rifles, each with its own characteristics and playstyle.</p>
